Sure, I can help you with that. Here is a basic Python script that reads parameters from .txt/.log files in a specified directory and triggers Jenkins jobs accordingly. Please note that you need to have the Jenkins Python API installed (`pip install python-jenkins`).

```python
import os
import jenkins

# Initialize Jenkins server
server = jenkins.Jenkins('http://localhost:8080', username='myuser', password='mypassword')

# Specify the directory containing the .txt/.log files
directory = '/path/to/your/directory'

# Iterate over each file in the directory
for filename in os.listdir(directory):
    if filename.endswith('.txt') or filename.endswith('.log'):
        filepath = os.path.join(directory, filename)

        # Read the file and extract parameters
        with open(filepath, 'r') as file:
            parameters = file.read().splitlines()

        # Trigger Jenkins job with parameters
        for job_name in parameters:
            server.build_job(job_name, parameters)

        print(f"Triggered Jenkins jobs for {filename}")
```

This script assumes that each line in the .txt/.log files corresponds to a Jenkins job name. You might need to adjust the script according to your specific use case and Jenkins setup. Also, please replace `'http://localhost:8080'`, `'myuser'`, and `'mypassword'` with your actual Jenkins server URL, username, and password respectively.

Please note that this script will trigger all jobs sequentially, one after another. If you want to run jobs in parallel, you might need to use threading or multiprocessing in Python, or consider using Jenkins Pipeline.

Remember to handle exceptions and errors appropriately in your production code. This is just a basic script to get you started. Let me know if you need further assistance! ðŸ˜Š
