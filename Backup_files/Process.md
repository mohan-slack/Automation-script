Note that you need to have Jenkins CLI and necessary permissions to execute Jenkins jobs.

1. **Install Jenkins CLI**: Jenkins provides a command-line interface (CLI) that allows users to access and manage Jenkins from a script or shell environment. You can download it from the Jenkins website.

2. **Prepare Your Input File**: Ensure your .txt file is properly formatted and accessible. Each line should contain the input values for one build.

3. **Create Your Script**: You can use Python or Shell script. The script should do the following:

    - Read the .txt file line by line.
    - For each line, trigger the Jenkins job with the input values.
    - Wait for 30 seconds before moving to the next line.
    - Stop when there are no more lines in the .txt file.

Here's a basic Python script that demonstrates this:

```python
import time
import subprocess

# Path to your input file
input_file = "/path/to/your/input.txt"

# Define a generator function to read the file line by line
def read_file_line_by_line(file_path):
    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
        for line in file:
            # Skip blank lines
            if line.strip():
                yield line.strip()
                
# Use the generator function to read the file
for line in read_file_line_by_line(input_file):
    # Split the line into parameters
    params = line.split(',')

    # Construct the command to trigger the Jenkins job
    cmd = f"java -jar jenkins-cli.jar -s https://jenkins.pruconnect.net/me/my-views/view/all/job/RT-SRE/job/PROD/job/infra/job/blueprint-azure-state-tools/ build blueprint-azure-state-tools -p TYPE={params[0]} -p APP_REF={params[1]} -p BRANCH={params[2]} -p STATE_ADDRESS={params[3]} -p TO_STATE_ADDRESS={params[4]}"
    
    # Trigger the Jenkins job and capture the return code
    result = subprocess.run(cmd, shell=True)

    # Check the return code
    if result.returncode != 0:
        print(f"Jenkins job failed with exit status {result.returncode}")
        # Handle the failure (e.g., retry, skip, or stop the script)
        break

    # Wait for 30 seconds before triggering the next build
    time.sleep(30)
```

Please replace `"http://localhost:8080/"` with your Jenkins server URL and `"your_job_name"` with your actual Jenkins job name.

4. **Run Your Script**: Execute your script. It will trigger the Jenkins job every 30 seconds with the next input values from the .txt file until all input values are used.

Please note that this is a basic script and might need to be adjusted based on your specific Jenkins setup and job configuration. Always ensure you have the necessary permissions to execute Jenkins jobs and handle any potential errors in your script. 

Also, remember to handle Jenkins job failures within the script. You might want to add some error checking to make sure each build is successful before moving on to the next one. If a build fails, you could choose to retry it, skip it, or stop the script entirely, depending on your needs. 

Lastly, be aware that triggering too many builds in a short period of time can put a lot of load on your Jenkins server. Make sure your server can handle the load, or consider adding longer delays between builds. 

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.
